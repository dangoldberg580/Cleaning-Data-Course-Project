# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Introduction

This readme file describes the Course Project for **Getting and Cleaning Data**.
The assignment required the merging of the test and training datasets into a *tidy dataset*, pulling the relevant metrics into another tidy dataset, getting the average of those metrics by subject and submitting that as a txt file.

## Data

The data files used were downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  This data was collected from the accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones from 30 subjects for both the testing and training datasets. There were 561 measurements taken while the subjects performed six different activities.

## R Script

The script for running this program should be placed in the same directory as the unzipped data files.

## Codebook

The codebook describes the step by step process along with the variable names and descriptions used in the R Script.
